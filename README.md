# This repository is for determining how the TMPHES capstone project might respond in a climate change lens

## EMDNA data notebooks:
- delta_analysis.ipynb (still in progress)
	- is the main notebook for analysing the emdna data based on temp, precip, evap and flow
- ET_penman.ipynb (still in progress)
	- this is the notebook where I update the EMDNA data with a calculated daily evaporation and upload a new file for every realization
- gridded_data_trange.ipynb
	- this transforms and uploads the EMDNA trange data to the right format 
- gridded_data.ipynb
	- this transforms and uploads the EMDNA temp and precip data to the right format


## WEATHERCAN data and GAUGE data notebooks:
- EDA.ipynb 
	- this notebook has all the work for exploratory data analysis of the weathercan data and the hydrological (gauge) data
	- It replicates a lot of the graphs that hatch created
	- shows correlation between stations
