# README for TM-PHES Data Analysis Repository

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the data analysis work for the Tent Mountain Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (TM-PHES) project. Located near the Crowsnest Pass in Alberta, this project aims to optimize the design of the Tent Mountain Upper and Lower Reservoirs and the North and South dams, ensuring 16-hour continuous operation while considering environmental, hydrological, and climate change impacts.

## Executive Summary
The report details the final design choices and findings from the TM-PHES project. Key activities included optimizing the Upper Reservoir design, sizing the Lower Reservoir, designing the dams, and conducting water balance, hydrological, and climate change impact analyses. The project leveraged a Hydrologic Engineering Center â€“ Hydrological Modelling System (HEC-HMS) model, the Linacre equation for evaporation rate calculation, and a GeoStudio seepage model. The analyses also covered future meteorological conditions under various climate change scenarios, providing insights into potential effects on the project, such as extreme outflow events and storage fluctuations. Additionally, an Operations Plan and a Mitigation and Adaptation Plan were developed to address regulatory, operational, and climate-related challenges.

## Repository Contents
